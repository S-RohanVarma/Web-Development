total war won by the Allied powers of the US, Great Britain, and the Soviet Union against the Axis powers of Nazi Germany,
 Italy, and Japan.

<h2>Who started World War 2 and why?</h2>
<p>Hitler's invasion of Poland in September 1939 drove Great Britain and France to declare war on Germany,
 marking the beginning of World War II. Over the next six years, the conflict would take more lives and destroy 
more land and property around the globe than any previous war.</p>

<p>World War II or the Second World War, often abbreviated as WWII or WW2, was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945. It involved the vast majority of the world's countries—including all of the great powers—forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis powers. In a total war directly involving more than 100 million personnel from more than 30 countries, the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, blurring the distinction between civilian and military resources. Aircraft played a major role in the conflict, enabling the strategic bombing of population centres and the only two uses of nuclear weapons in war. World War II was by far the deadliest conflict in human history; it resulted in 70 to 85 million fatalities, a majority being civilians. Tens of millions of people died due to genocides (including the Holocaust), starvation, massacres, and disease. In the wake of the Axis defeat, Germany and Japan were occupied, and war crimes tribunals were conducted against German and Japanese leaders.

World War II is generally considered to have begun on 1 September 1939, when Nazi Germany, under Adolf Hitler, invaded Poland. The United Kingdom and France subsequently declared war on Germany on 3 September. Under the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact of August 1939, Germany and the Soviet Union had partitioned Poland and marked out their "spheres of influence" across Finland, Romania and the Baltic states. From late 1939 to early 1941, in a series of campaigns and treaties, Germany conquered or controlled much of continental Europe, and formed the Axis alliance with Italy and Japan (along with other countries later on). Following the onset of campaigns in North Africa and East Africa, and the fall of France in mid-1940, the war continued primarily between the European Axis powers and the British Empire, with war in the Balkans, the aerial Battle of Britain, the Blitz of the UK, and the Battle of the Atlantic. On 22 June 1941, Germany led the European Axis powers in an invasion of the Soviet Union, opening the Eastern Front, the largest land theatre of war in history.</p><image src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/34/Changde_battle.jpg/219px-Changde_battle.jpg"><image src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9d/2-8_Field_Regt.jpg/207px-2-8_Field_Regt.jpg"><br>

<div id="item1">Aircraft in World War 2:
In World War I, aircraft were dangerous flying tin cans. At the beginning of World War II, the situation was the same, but then with advanced technology the planes became stronger, faster, safer, and more accurate.
</div>
<div id="item2">Submarines of World War 2:
Submarines have a long history. In 1580, a British innkeeper, William Bourne, actually drew a diagram of a submarine. In 1623, a Dutchman named Cornelius Drebbel built a working submarine for King James I. in 1654, a Frenchman named De Son built a submarine called the Rotterdam Boat and was used by Belgium to attack the British Navy.
 </div>
<div id="item3">World War II Aircraft Carriers:
An aircraft carrier serves many functions during war. Think of it as a floating city where planes can depart from, supplies can be moved from, and service men and women can be relocated from in time of need, and planes can land. The Cambridge Dictionary defines an aircraft carrier as, “ a large ship that carries military aircraft and has a long, flat surface where they can take off and land.”
